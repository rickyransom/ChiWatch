#### MVP

> _The ChiWatch Minimum Viable Product of this project is to simply receive the user input, based on selected dataset filters (Year Of Complaint, Ethnicity of Complaintant, Category of Offense,etc) and output the visualization of that data in simple web application that emulates a social media post


<br>

#### Goals

- _Render the info about the incident in a  front end visual format that looks similar to Facebook status with a graph and portion of the table underneath
- _Have a graph or chart feature that shows the # of incidents by category vs the year._

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                      |

#### Component Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above. 
>
> Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Structure           |    M     |     2.5 hrs      |    3hrs     |    TBD       |
| React-Table         |    M     |     2 hrs      |     2hrs     |    TBD       |
| React-Graph         |    L     |     2 hrs      |     2hrs     |    TBD       |
|   The Report /CRUD  |    H     |     4 hrs      |     5hrs     |     TBD      |
| TOTAL               |          |     16.5 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

#### Helper Functions

> Use this section to document all helper functionsâ€“ generic functions that can be reused in other applications.

|  Function  | Description                                |
| :--------: | :----------------------------------------- |
| Capitalize | _                                       ._ |

### Post-MVP

> _How do I allow users to add to this data by reporting their own incidents themselves, rather than rely on The Thurgood database?
> _Increase functionality by also allowing neighborhood watch feature to allow concernced citizen to report on false complaints or incidents of abuse of this tool, such as local trouble makers, burgulars or gang memebers who may file false or exaggertated complaints.
> _Add  a feature to contact legislation in the city of Chicago with a contact form or digital suggestion box where citizens can suggest policies they would like to see implemented
